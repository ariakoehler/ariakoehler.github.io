Hi there! I'm Aria, I write, I do math, I work with (D)ata, I bleed, I weep, I sweat. In my spare time I listen to music, read books, play Magic: the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons, go for runs, and generally try to stay afloat in this profoundly strange time we live in. I try not to define myself in terms of any of those things, but I find it a little bit magical that I could flit between a dozen different groups, all of whom would identify me different.

While we're simply listing things about ourselves, I guess it's relevant that I have both a B.S. and an M.S. in Applied Mathematics, with a scattering of minors across a bunch of disparate topics. Don't worry, this page won't devolve into simply listing pieces of paper I have because I find that to not be a terribly useful way to establish credibility or identity. Besides, if you care you should probably just be looking at my LinkedIn anyways.

In some ways putting this out to the internet is a rebellion against having to define myself with specific labels. Who am I? I have no fucking clue, but I can show you what's going on in my mind. What does it mean to be a woman? I couldn't really tell you, but I can tell you how womanhood plays on my everyday life. What are my religious feelings? Oftentimes a poem dealing with particulars can express a thought better than a philosophical treatise dealing with abstracts.

But this was supposed to be about me, right?

I guess it is, in a sense. The phrase "about me" is a little funny. Historically the word ["about"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/about#etymonline_v_63) had more of an implication of physical nearness, closer to our modern usage of "around." This page orbits around me, recording views from different angles but never touching me.
