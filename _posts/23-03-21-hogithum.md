*Molag Bal wanted my mind, Boethiah wanted my arms, and Nocturnal perhaps my curiosity. Azura wants all of that, and our love above all. Not our abject slavering, but our honest and genuine caring in all its forms. It is important to her that our emotions be engaged in her worship. And our love must also be directed inward. If we love her and hate ourselves, she feels our pain. I will, for all time, have no other mistress.*

Happy Hogithum! Today is the summoning day of the Lady of Dawn and Dusk, the Daedric Prince Azura. At least as practiced in the Iliac Bay regionin the fictional world of Nirn, where the Elder Scrolls take place. If you're familiar at all with the Elder Scrolls games, you've likely heard of 2011's Skyrim, or perhaps 2006's Oblivion. My personal favorite is 2002's Morrowind, but they're all really fantastic games. But I'm not really here to talk video game criticism, I'm writing to discuss queerness and how I've explored my own gender through this particular cast of fictional characters.

The Daedra of the Elder Scrolls are often clumsily compared to the demons of our very Western, black-and-white framework for understanding the supernatural. The Divines are gods, which are good, and the Daedra are demons, which are bad. Very simple, cut-and-dry, no nuance. But, as with the inspirations of the real-world demons of the world's major monotheistic religions, the Daedra are quite a bit more interesting.
