<strong>
You know it's about to happen.
</strong>

<strong>
Warm up your engine,  
go scrunching along  
gravelly low-ways paved with  
your own pen.
</strong>

<strong>
The road is shit-slick  
from raccoons  
who skitter at your scent.
</strong>

<strong>
Tires slodge  
through creeks made of  
prepositions and filler.
</strong>

<strong>
And that  
old-man-hands oak,  
almost ready to  
*snap*  
and crush you under the weight  
of your misplaced words.
</strong>

<strong>
Who's that  
in the passenger seat?  
They used to live in your mirror,  
but now you don't recognize them.  
They meet your eyes and ask,  
*What's that knife for?*
</strong>


<strong>
You had better not tell them.  
Use it.
