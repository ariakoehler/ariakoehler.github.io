<strong>
Let me tell you about the days I was struck blind.
I huffed and scraped through heaps of kinck-knacks,
trying to put my finger on the girl I had killed.
If I could just find her left-behinds.
</strong>

<strong>
Awareness first felt in the cuticles, then the sides of the skull,
threatened to stop up my nose, corrode the walls of my kidneys,
when through a hand mirror a glimpse of the Goddess
spaghettied itself about my shoulders.
She just giggled,
the way only a true flirt can
while my irises
screwed in
and in and in until
she filled my field of vision,
or rather,
the gray hair just above her brow.
</strong>

<strong>
I tumbled through a new rhythm of half-hours,
where reassurances fell like cymbals
and every map is an untrimmed armpit.

I tumbled through a new rhythm of half-hours,
where reassurances fell like cymbals
and every map is an untrimmed armpit.
</strong>

<strong>
As I ripped through pages, my lover whispered me a proverb
traced in saltwater,
and a soon-forgotten hairdresser taught me to pray for
rat infestations.
</strong>

<strong>
Each night venom would claw through my arms
tightening its grip like a knot yanked by the grip of my eyelids.
Like briars.
</strong>

<strong>
Then one flyby day I heard the Goddess behind me insulting.
When I wheeled to disarm her, all I met with
was glass
shattering,
and I surfaced,
gasping for air.
