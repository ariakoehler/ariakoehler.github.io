<strong>
Last night, we chased the warm and trapped it close  
within bug jars made of plywood and drywall.  
Wake up to a sky of pillows, soft and perfect  
for smothering. And yet, the day is fickle.
</strong>

<strong>
*Ta-tat, ta-tat,* onto the everdry  
asphalt, where bruises form, then heal, then form  
again before they grab us by the feet.
</strong>

<strong>
City dwellers who will Whack-A-Mole  
from windows will confirm the news. Light  
will charge the barricade of clouds and tear  
apart the interstitial lattice above,  
that liquid light and rays of rain might fall  
as one and intermingle.
</strong>

<strong>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob's ladders,  
which in other lives might herald red  
or blind will splinter from head-ons with stray  
children of clouds, to break off beams which fall  
on bricks, in leaves, to lovers' windowsills.
</strong>
